        I was born in Kerala, India with the name Cherry. Cherry was a pretty common name in Kerala
        & I was actually named after my grandfather (his name was Cherian).
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately when my family moved to the US, my parents quickly realized that they had named their son after a
        fruit...
        So in an attempt to spare me a life of ridicule, they renamed me to Ryan. ('Ryan' comes from the 'rian' in
        'Cherian')
        <br /><br />
        Unfortunately, despite their efforts, I found plenty of other ways to ridicule myself over the years
        (I had a particularly embarrasing hairdo throughout highschool/college).
        So ultimately I resolved to just stick with Cherry.
        <br /><br />
        The end result? I'm officially Ryan on paper, but everyone just calls me Cherry!
        <br /><br />
        ..which is good, I prefer Cherry :)
